            <div class="container">
                <h2>An Overview</h2>
                <p>Olive is a mobile application designed to promote user well-being by offering a wide range of health
                    and
                    wellness resources.
                    The goal of the project was to provide a users a platform that empowers them to take control of
                    their
                    health
                    journey.
                    This involved creating an intuitive, accessible, as well as an aesthetically pleasing app.</p>
                <p>This project was conceived and developed as a part of a CareerFoundry UX Bootcamp, in which I
                    undertook
                    various roles and responsibilities, encompassing every aspect of the project's lifecycle. I assumed
                    the
                    role
                    of UX researcher to understand user pain points, needs, and preferences.
                    As a UX designer, I utilized an iterative design approach to continually refine the app's prototype
                    based on
                    user feedback and user testing.
                    This holistic approach allowed for a comprehensive understanding of the project from its inception
                    to
                    completion.</p>

                <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
                <p>Olive users need an intuitive app with a personalized user experience to track and gain insights into
                    their
                    health metrics, ultimately allowing them to effectively monitor their comprehensive health journey
                    to
                    improve their health and wellness. We will know this to be true when we see an increase in the
                    number of
                    users who customize their profile, adjust settings and use personalized options within the app.</p>

                <h2>Solution</h2>
                <p>Provide a personalized user experience on Olive for individuals to track and improve their health and
                    wellness. </p>
                Features which must be included in the app are:
                <ul>
                    <li>profile page where users can adjust their needs such as dietary preferences and notifications
                    </li>
                    <li>ability to access health resources</li>
                    <li>nutrition logging and health journaling</li>
                    <li>health management by letting users track and record their doctor visits, (as well as
                        medications,
                        vaccines, and treatments)</li>
                    <li>tracking fitness via a wearable device</li>
                </ul>
                <p> As users input their health vitals on the app, there should a clear way of accessing their progress
                    and
                    reviewing their journey. This can be depicted via descriptive progress charts and pie charts.</p>

                <h2>Tools Used</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Figma</li>
                    <li>Optimal Sort</li>
                    <li>Google Sheets and Google Docs</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Let's understand the users</h2>

                    <source srcset="img/olive-app/small-pictures/learning-users-1x.jpg" media="(max-width: 767px)">
                    <img src="img/olive-app/large-pictures/learning-users-2x.jpg" alt="User Details">
                </picture>

                <h2>Who are the users?</h2>
                <picture>
                    <source srcset="img/olive-app/small-pictures/users-1x.jpg" media="(max-width: 767px)">

                </picture>

                <h2>Creating user journeys and mental models for a deeper understanding</h2>
                <p>This process helped me to understand pain points users might face and how I can overcome their issue.
                    Once I
                    had established my persona's mental models, I was able to create their user flows. User flows are
                    vital
                    for
                    understanding user behavior. By mapping these steps, as a designer I am able to gain insights into
                    user
                    behavior, preferences, and pain points.</p>

                </picture>

                <h2>I connected the dots and created a sitemap</h2>
                <p>This was a crucial step to organize all the information in a logical and reasonable manner. Since
                    this is
                    a
                    mobile app, I have to keep in mind that I have limited screen real estate, therefore navigation must
                    be
                    efficient and well-structured.</p>

                </picture>

                <h2>Using the sitemaps, I created wireframes</h2>
                <p>I began creating my low to mid fidelity wireframes. At this stage, the wireframes were defined enough
                    for
                    some user testing. Based on 2 tests, I've made a few alternations and moved on to creating
                    high-fidelity
                    prototypes.</p>

                </picture>

                <h2>We made it this far! Now time for user testing...</h2>
                <p>I conducted a moderated usability test with 6 participants for Olive, focusing on the overall user
                    experience
                    and specific features. The app aims to help users track their health, access educational health
                    related
                    resources, and engage with the community. The test will evaluate the usability and effectiveness of
                    the
                    app
                    in meeting user needs. </p>
                Goals:
                <ul>
                    <li>Assess the app's dashboard and ease of use</li>
                    <li>Evaluate the effectiveness of the onboarding process</li>
                    <li>Evaluate the effectiveness of tracking health data and accessing resources</li>
                    <li>Gather feedback on the overall user experiences and satisfaction with the appâ€™s features
                    </li>
                </ul>

                Test Objectives:
                <ul>
                    <li>Evaluate the onboarding process</li>
                    <li>Evaluate the clarity and intuitiveness of the app's dashboard/ homepage</li>
                    <li>Assess the ease of tracking health data and accessing related features (appointments,
                        medications,
                        etc.)
                    </li>
                    <li> Access the health education resources section</li>
                    <li>Logging nutritional information with ease</li>
                    <li>Identify any usability issues or areas for improvements in the user flow and interactions</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>UI Designing to bring the ideas to life</h2>
                <p>Once the usability issues were resolved, I moved on to design the final screens in Figma. The design
                    follows
                    a vibrant and engaging approach, featuring lively and colorful illustrations. Illustrations add a
                    touch
                    of
                    playfulness, thus making it more approachable.</p>
                <p>Rooted in Material Design principles, the interface maintains
                    simplicity and cleanliness throughout as the participants in user testing had desired. While
                    learning
                    about
                    design, I understood the importance of inclusivity. My design includes accessibility features such
                    as
                    voice
                    navigation and dark mode. In this design I wanted to strike a harmonious balance of visual appeal
                    and
                    usability. I wanted to create an enjoyable and accessible app for users to track their health,
                    access
                    resources, and engage with the community.</p>

                </picture>

                <h2>Provinding a personalized experience was essential</h2>
                <p>Tracking ones health and wellness journey is a very personal experience, therefore I provided options
                    of
                    personalization in multiple ways. Keeping accessibility in mind, I allowed for dark mode, screen
                    reading,
                    and text size adjustments. </p>
                <p>Users are able to gamify their journey and track their achievements and remain
                    motivated. There are ways to adjust dietary preferences, manage notifications, and pair their
                    wearable
                    fitness devices. Another important thing is that as the user keeps interacting with the app, the app
                    will
                    keep recommending resources which may interest the users on their dashboard.</p>
